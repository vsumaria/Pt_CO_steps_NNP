This code for performing BHMC simulations is adapted from:
 https://github.com/GengSS/catalapp
 
An example of running the code has been included. 
  - chemical_potential.dat --> used to calculated the free energy while performing BHMC
  - in.opt --> lammps script for relaxation
  - run_bh.py --> Run script
